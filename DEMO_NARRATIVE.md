# AgentChain Demo Narrative: "Trustless AI Execution"

**Theme:** "Don't just run AI. Verify it."
**Time:** ~3 Minutes
**Goal:** Prove that AgentChain solves the "Black Box" problem of Crypto AI agents through Simulation, Consensus, and Economic Security.

## 0. Intro: The Problem
*(Start on the **Dashboard**)*

**Speaker:**
"Right now, using an on-chain AI agent is a leap of faith. You give it a wallet, type a prompt, and pray it doesn't drain your funds.
We built **AgentChain** to solve this. We are the **Trust Layer** for the AI economy, giving you 'Skin in the Game' security, pre-execution safety, and post-execution proofs."

## 1. The Marketplace of Trust
*(Stay on **Dashboard**. Hover over cards.)*

**Speaker:**
"This isn't just a list of bots. It's a curated registry. Notice the **Stake Badges**?
*   **Action:** Hover over 'Yield Sentinel' (50,000 SHM Stake).
*   **Say:** "To be listed here, this developer had to lock 50,000 SHM. If this agent acts maliciously, the DAO slashes that money. We align incentives with economic security."

"We also enable sustainable business models."
*   **Action:** Click the **Premium Agent** (Alpha Predator). shows Subscription Modal.
*   **Say:** "High-performance agents effectively become SaaS products. Users can subscribe on-chain to unlock institutional-grade logic."
*   **Action:** Close Modal.

## 2. The Safety Sandwich (Pre-Execution)
*(Click **'Yield Sentinel'** to enter Interaction Pane)*

**Speaker:**
"Let's look at our 'Safety Sandwich' architecture. It wraps the black-box AI logic with protection layers."

### Feature A: Simulation Mode
*   **Action:** Type prompt: *"Maximize yield on my stablecoins"* (or use Template Pill).
*   **Action:** Toggle **"Simulation Mode"** switch ON.
*   **Action:** Click **"Run Simulation"**.
*   **Say:** "Before I sign anything, I run a Simulation. This forks the current Shardeum state locally and dry-runs the agent's plan.
    *   *Result appears.* "See? It predicts the exact Gas usage, APR, and most importantly—a **Risk Score**. I know the outcome before I spend a cent."

### Feature B: The AI Roundtable (Consensus)
*   **Action:** Reset (Click New Command).
*   **Say:** "But what if I don't trust just one model? I want a second opinion."
*   **Action:** Click the **"Consensus"** (Users Icon) button. (Wait for loading...)
*   **Say:** "We convene an 'AI Roundtable'. Three independent agent nodes debate the strategy.
    *   *Cards appear.* "Here we have a Conservative plan (Safety First), a Balanced plan, and a Degen plan. I'm not stuck with one black box; I have choices."
*   **Action:** Click **"Select"** on the Balanced Strategy.

## 3. The Execution & Audit (Post-Execution)
*   **Action:** Click **"Approve in Wallet"**.
*   **Say:** "The specific logic I selected is now executed on Shardeum."
    *   *Success screen appears.*

**Speaker:**
"For most users, that's enough. But for enterprises, we need proof."
*   **Action:** Click **"Back to Dashboard"** -> Go to **"Activity"** tab.

### Feature C: Audit & Replay
*   **Action:** Point to the table.
*   **Say:** "Every action is logged. But check this out..."
*   **Action:** Click the **"JSON"** button/icon on a row. (File downloads).
*   **Say:** "I can export a cryptographic Audit Report. This contains the prompt, the MCP data sources, and the agent's reasoning chain. It's compliance-ready."

*   **Action:** Hover over a red "Failed" transaction row.
*   **Action:** Click the **"Replay"** button.
*   **Say:** "And if a transaction fails? We offer **Forensic Replay**. We can rewind the blockchain state to that exact block and walk through the Agent's memory to see exactly why it crashed."

---

## 4. The Governance Enforcer
*   **Action:** Go to **"Governance"** tab.

**Speaker:**
"Results matter. If an Agent violates its safety promise, the community acts."
*   **Action:** Point to the red **Slashing Proposal**.
*   **Say:** "Here, the DAO isn't just voting on parameters. They are voting to **SLASH** a malicious agent's stake. Code is law, but humans are the judge."

## 5. Conclusion
**Speaker:**
"AgentChain turns AI from a 'Black Box' into a 'Glass Box'. We give you the tools verify, simulate, and audit every move. Thank you."
